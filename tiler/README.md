# Maptiles from GeoTiff

* This script creates white tiles from a GeoTiff using Floodfill in a height range with custom steps and zoom levels.
* ~MapTiler Pro and~ GDAL must be installed and set in the PATH variable in order for this script to execute.
* Executing this script might take several hours depending on zoom levels.
* on a 48-core machine using `tiler_parallel.py` this took about 13500s (round 4h) using all heights and zoom levels up to and including 14 (Jan. 2018).

## General Usage (all parameters are mandatory, height in metres, output directory must be empty):

* tiler.py calc inputfile outputdirectory min_height max_height step min_zoom max_zoom

## Usage with docker-compose

* Download DEM Data from copernicus: https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/satellite-derived-products/eu-dem/eu-dem-v1.1?tab=mapview
  * only select your area of interest
* unzip the zip (inside the other zip)
* move the TIF to `data`
  * If you need to use multiple tif, either joine them to one big tiff, or alternatively use a `.vrt` file and adapt the compose file accordingly..
* Download a Shapefile with the area (ie. Country) and rename it to `area.shp` (all files!) and move them to the data directory
* Example area.shp is Switzerland (from: https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-land-flaeche.fill/shp/21781/ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-land-flaeche.fill.zip)

Adapt the environment variables as needed, then run:

* `docker-compose run --rm tiler docker_run.sh`
